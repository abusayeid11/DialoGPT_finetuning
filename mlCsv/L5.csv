Naïve Bayes Model 
Naïve Bayes Algorithm 
•The naïve Bayes algorithm finds its roots in statistics and probability 
theory. 
The Bayes theorem 
•The naïve Bayesian algorithm is built on the Bayes’ theorem, named 
after Thomas Bayes. 
•The Bayes’ theorem is one of the most influential and important 
concepts in statistics and probability theory. 
The Bayes theorem 
•The Bayes’ theorem provides a mathematical expression for 
—how a degree of subjective belief changes to account for new 
evidence.
