"What is linear regression?","Linear regression computes the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent features by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. It is used to predict continuous output variables."
"Is linear regression a supervised learning algorithm?","Yes, linear regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that learns from labeled datasets and maps the data points using optimized linear functions for prediction."
"Give an example of a linear regression use case.","Predicting house prices based on features such as house age, area, distance from the main road, location, and number of rooms."
"What is the objective of linear regression?","The primary objective is to find the best-fit line that minimizes the error between predicted values and actual values."
"What does the best-fit line represent?","It represents the linear relationship between dependent and independent variables. The slope indicates how much the dependent variable changes per unit change in an independent variable."
"What are the types of linear regression?", "There are two main types: Simple Linear Regression (Univariate), Multiple Linear Regression (Multivariate)"
"What is simple linear regression?","It models the relationship between one independent variable and one dependent variable. For example, predicting exam scores based on study hours."
"What is multiple linear regression?","Multiple linear regression models the relationship between multiple independent variables and one dependent variable."
"What are some use cases of multiple linear regression?","Real Estate Pricing: Predicting house prices based on size, location, and number of rooms. Financial Forecasting: Predicting stock prices using factors like inflation and interest rates. Agricultural Yield Prediction: Estimating crop yield using rainfall, soil quality, and fertilizer usage. E-commerce Analysis: Understanding how price, marketing, and season affect sales."
"What is the cost function in linear regression?","The cost function measures the error between predicted values and actual values, and is minimized to optimize the model (usually Mean Squared Error)."
"What are regularization techniques used in linear models?","Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization), Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization), Elastic Net Regression: A combination of both L1 and L2."
"What is the equation of a simple linear regression line?","The general form is: y = a * x + b, where y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, a is the slope, and b is the intercept."
"How is the linear regression equation calculated analytically?","By using the least squares method on data points, minimizing the sum of squared errors to find the best-fit line."
"What is logistic regression?","Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks, especially binary classification."
"What does logistic regression predict?","It predicts the probability that a given instance belongs to a particular class (e.g., Yes or No, 0 or 1)."
"How is logistic regression related to linear regression?","Although named 'regression', it is an extension of linear regression used for classification, not regression."
"How does logistic regression make predictions?","By applying the sigmoid function to the linear combination of inputs, producing a value between 0 and 1, interpreted as probability."
"What is the sigmoid function in logistic regression?","A mathematical function that maps input values to a range between 0 and 1 in an S-shaped curve. If the output is ≥ 0.5, the class is 1; otherwise, it's class 0."
"What type of variable does logistic regression predict?","It predicts categorical (discrete) outcomes, such as Yes/No or 0/1."
"What is the threshold in logistic regression?","The threshold (commonly 0.5) is used to decide class membership: if the sigmoid output is above the threshold, the instance belongs to one class; otherwise, it belongs to the other."
"Can linear regression work on classification data?","No. It predicts the continuous output variables based on the independent input variable."
"Can linear regression work on continuous data?","Yes. It predicts the continuous output variables based on the independent input variable." 
"How linear regression model makes prediction?","It learns from the labelled datasets and maps the data points with most optimized linear functions which can be used for prediction on new datasets." 
"How linear regression can be used to predict house prices?","Predict house price considering various factor such as house age, distance from the main road, location, area and number of room. Linear regression uses all these parameter to predict house price as it consider a linear relation between all these features and price of house."
"Give example where linear regression can be used?","To examine the relationship between study hours and exam scores. To forecast sales based on historical data particularly examining how factors like advertising expenditure influence revenue." 
"What is the difference between linear regression and logistic regression?","In Logistic regression, instead of fitting a regression line, we fit an “S” shaped logistic function, which predicts two maximum values (0 or 1)."
