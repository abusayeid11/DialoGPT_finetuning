Linear Regression 
Linear Regression 
•Linear regression computes the linear relationship between the 
dependent variable and one or more independent features by fitting 
a linear equation with observed data. 
•It predicts the continuous output variables based on the independent 
input variable. 
Linear Regression 
•Linear regression is also a type of supervised ML algorithm. 
•It learns from the labelled datasets and maps the data points with 
most optimized linear functions which can be used for prediction on 
new datasets. 
Linear Regression 
•For example: 
•Predict house price considering various factor such as house age, 
distance from the main road, location, area and number of room 
•Linear regression uses all these parameter to predict house price as it 
consider a linear relation between all these features and price of 
house. 
Best Fit Line 
•Primary objective while using linear regression is to locate the best-fit 
line, which implies that the error between the predicted and actual 
values should be kept to a minimum. 
•There will be the least error in the best-fit line. 
Best Fit Line 
•The best Fit Line equation provides a straight line that represents the 
relationship between the dependent and independent variables. 
•The slope of the line indicates how much the dependent variable 
changes for a unit change in the independent variable(s).

Types of Linear Regression 
•Simple Linear Regression or Univariate Linear Regression 
•Multiple Linear Regression or Multivariate Regression

•Use cases: 
•To examine the relationship between study hours and exam scores. 
•To forecast sales based on historical data particularly examining how 
factors like advertising expenditure influence revenue. 
Multiple Linear Regression 
• 
Multiple Linear Regression 
•Real Estate Pricing: In real estate MLR is used to predict property 
prices based on multiple factors such as location, size, number of 
bedrooms, etc. This helps buyers and sellers understand market 
trends and set competitive prices. 
•Financial Forecasting: Financial analysts use MLR to predict stock 
prices or economic indicators based on multiple influencing factors 
such as interest rates, inflation rates and market trends. This enables 
better investment strategies and risk management. 
Multiple Linear Regression 
•Agricultural Yield Prediction: Farmers can use MLR to estimate crop 
yields based on several variables like rainfall, temperature, soil quality 
and fertilizer usage. This information helps in planning agricultural 
practices for optimal productivity 
•E-commerce Sales Analysis: An e-commerce company can utilize MLR 
to assess how various factors such as product price, marketing 
promotions and seasonal trends impact sales.

Logistic Regression 
Logistic Regression 
•Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used 
for classification tasks .
•The goal is to predict the probability that an instance belongs to a 
given class or not. 
Logistic Regression 
•Logistic regression is used for binary classification where we 
use sigmoid function , that takes input as independent variables and 
produces a probability value between 0 and 1. 
•For example, we have two classes Class 0 and Class 1 if the value of 
the logistic function for an input is greater than 0.5 (threshold value) 
then it belongs to Class 1 otherwise it belongs to Class 0. 
•It’s referred to as regression because it is the extension of linear 
regression but is mainly used for classification problems. 
Logistic Regression 
•Logistic regression predicts the output of a categorical dependent 
variable. Therefore, the outcome must be a categorical or discrete 
value. 
•It can be either Yes or No, 0 or 1, true or False, etc. but instead of 
giving the exact value as 0 and 1, it gives the probabilistic values 
which lie between 0 and 1. 
•In Logistic regression, instead of fitting a regression line, we fit an “S” 
shaped logistic function, which predicts two maximum values (0 or 1). 
Logistic Function – Sigmoid Function 
•The S-form curve is called the 
Sigmoid function or the logistic 
function. 
•In logistic regression, we use the 
concept of the threshold value, 
which defines the probability of 
either 0 or 1. Such as values 
above the threshold value tends 
to 1, and a value below the 
threshold values tends to 0.
