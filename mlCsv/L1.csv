Data Science 
•Data science is also commonly referred to as 
•knowledge discovery 
•machine learning 
•predictive analytics 
•data mining. 
•However, each term has a slightly different connotation depending 
on the context. 
AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science 
AI
•Artificial intelligence is about giving machines the capability of 
mimicking human behavior, particularly cognitive functions. 
•Examples would be: facial recognition, automated driving, sorting 
mail based on postal code. 
•There are quite a range of techniques that fall under artificial 
intelligence: linguistics, natural language processing, decision science, 
bias, vision, robotics, planning, etc. 
•Learning is an important part of human capability. 
Machine Learning 
•Machine learning can either be considered a sub-field or one of the 
tools of artificial intelligence, is providing machines with the 
capability of learning from experience. 
•Experience for machines comes in the form of data. 
Data Science 
•Data science is the business application of machine learning, artificial 
intelligence, and other quantitative fields like statistics, visualization, and 
mathematics. 
•In the context of how data science is used today, it relies heavily on 
machine learning and is sometimes called data mining. 
•Examples of data science user cases are: 
•recommendation engines that can recommend movies for a particular 
user, 
•a fraud alert model that detects fraudulent credit card transactions, 
•find customers who will most likely churn next month, 
•predict revenue for the next quarter.

Machine Learning 
•Machine learning is providing machines with the capability of learning 
from experience. Experience for machines comes in the form of data. 
•Data that is used to teach machines is called training data. 
•Machine learning turns the traditional programing model upside 
down. 
Machine Learning 
Machine Learning 
•A program, a set of instructions to a computer, transforms input signals 
into output signals using predetermined rules and relationships. 
•Machine learning algorithms, also called “learners”, take both the known 
input and output (training data) to figure out a model for the program 
which converts input to output. 
•For example, many organizations like social media platforms, review sites, 
or forums are required to moderate posts and remove abusive content. 
•How can machines be taught to automate the removal of abusive content? 
Machine Learning 
•The machines need to be shown examples of both abusive and 
non-abusive posts with a clear indication of which one is abusive. 
•The learners will generalize a pattern based on certain words or 
sequences of words in order to conclude whether the overall post is 
abusive or not. The model can take the form of a set of “if-then” 
rules. 
•Once the data science rules or model is developed, machines can 
start categorizing the disposition of any new posts. 
Machine Learning Types 
•Machine learning is usually divided into two main types: 
•Supervised learning 
•Unsupervised learning 
•There is a third type of machine learning, known as Reinforcement 
learning 
Supervised Learning 
•A training set of examples with the correct responses ( targets ) is 
provided and, based on this training set, the algorithm generalises to 
respond correctly to all possible inputs. 
•This is also called learning from exemplars . 
Unsupervised Learning 
•Correct responses are not provided, but instead the algorithm tries to 
identify similarities between the inputs so that inputs that have 
something in common are categorised together. 
•The statistical approach to unsupervised learning is known as density 
estimation . 
Reinforcement Learning 
•This is somewhere between supervised and unsupervised learning. 
•The algorithm gets told when the answer is wrong, but does not get 
told how to correct it. 
•It has to explore and try out different possibilities until it works out 
how to get the answer right. 
•Reinforcement learning is sometime called learning with a critic 
because of this monitor that scores the answer, but does not suggest 
improvements. 
Supervised Learning Applications 
•Classification 
•Document classification and email spam filtering 
•Classifying flowers 
•Image classification and handwriting recognition 
•Face detection and recognition 
Supervised Learning Applications 
•Regression 
•Predict tomorrow’s stock market price given current market 
conditions and other possible side information. 
•Predict the age of a viewer watching a given video on YouTube. 
•Predict the location in 3d space of a robot arm end effector, given 
control signals (torques) sent to its various motors. 
•Predict the amount of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in the body 
as a function of a number of different clinical measurements. 
•Predict the temperature at any location inside a building using 
weather data, time, door sensors, etc. 
Unsupervised Learning Applications 
•Discovering clusters 
•Discovering latent factors – dimensionality reduction 
•Discovering graph structure 
•Matrix completion 
•Image inpainting 
•Collaborative filtering 
•Market basket analysis"
