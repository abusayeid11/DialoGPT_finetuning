Machine (SVM) 
Support Vector Machine 
•Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning 
algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. 
•While it can handle regression problems, SVM is particularly 
well-suited for classification tasks. 
Support Vector Machine 
•SVM aims to find the optimal hyperplane in an N-dimensional space 
to separate data points into different classes. 
•The algorithm maximizes the margin between the closest points of 
different classes. 
Support Vector Machine 
SVM Terminology 
•Hyperplane : A decision boundary separating different classes in 
feature space, represented by the equation wx + b = 0 in linear 
classification. 
•Support Vectors : The closest data points to the hyperplane, crucial 
for determining the hyperplane and margin in SVM. 
SVM Terminology 
•Margin : The distance between the hyperplane and the support 
vectors. SVM aims to maximize this margin for better classification 
performance. 
•Hard Margin : A maximum-margin hyperplane that perfectly 
separates the data without misclassifications. 
•Soft Margin : Allows some misclassifications by introducing slack 
variables, balancing margin maximization and misclassification 
penalties when data is not perfectly separable. 
Types of SVM 
•Linear SVM: 
•Linear SVMs use a linear decision boundary 
to separate the data points of different 
classes. 
•Non-Linear SVM: 
•Non-Linear SVM can be used to classify 
data when it cannot be separated into two 
classes by a straight line (in the case of 2D). 
•By using kernel functions, nonlinear SVMs 
can handle nonlinearly separable data. 
Kernel Functions 
•A kernel is a mathematical function that helps organize data and 
make it easier to classify. 
•Kernels help by implicitly mapping the original feature space into a 
higher-dimensional space where the data might be more easily 
separable. 
•Using proper kernel function with SVM, a non-linear decision 
boundary can be treated as linear. 
Kernel Functions 
•When data is not linearly 
separable (i.e., it can’t be 
divided by a straight line), SVM 
uses kernels to map the data 
into a higher-dimensional space 
where it becomes separable. 
•This transformation helps SVM 
find a decision boundary even 
for non-linear data.
