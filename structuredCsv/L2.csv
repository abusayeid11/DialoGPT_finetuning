A data point (record, object or example) - is a single instance in the dataset. An attribute (feature, input, dimension, variable, or predictor) - is a single property of the dataset. A label (class label, output, prediction, target, or response) - is the special attribute to be predicted based on all the input attributes. Identifiers - are special attributes that are used for locating or providing context to individual records."
"What is dataset?",A dataset (example set) is a collection of data with a defined structure." 
"What is data point?", "A data point (record, object or example) is a single instance in the dataset."

"What is label?","A label (class label, output, prediction, target, or response) is the special attribute to be predicted based on all the input attributes." 
"What are identifiers?","Identifiers are special attributes that are used for locating or providing context to individual records."
"What is the difference between Causation and Correlation?","The correlation between the input and output attributes doesnâ€™t guarantee causation. Hence, it is important to frame the data science question correctly using the existing domain and data knowledge." 
"Why Data Preparation ia needed?","Most of the data science algorithms would require data to be structured in a tabular format with records in the rows and attributes in the columns."
"How ca we cange data format?","If the data is in any other format, the data would need to be transformed by applying pivot, type conversion, join, or transpose functions, etc., to condition the data into the required structure."
"Tell the steps of data preparation","Data preparation involves: Data Exploration, Data Quality, Missing Values, Data Types and Conversation, Transformation, Outliers, Feature Selection, Data Sampling." 
"What is data exploration?","Data exploration also known as exploratory data analysis, provides a set of simple tools to achieve basic understanding of the data." 
"How Data exploration works?","Data Exploration approaches involve computing descriptive statistics and visualization of data. They can expose the structure of the data, the distribution of the values, the presence of extreme values, and highlight the inter-relationships within the dataset."
"How Statistics is related to Data Science?","Descriptive statistics like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range for each attribute provide an easily readable summary of the key characteristics of the distribution of data."
"Why visualization is used in data science?","A visual plot of data points provides an instant grasp of all the data points condensed into one chart." 
"What is data quality in context of data science?","Data quality is an ongoing concern wherever data is collected, processed, and stored."
"What is missing value?","One of the most common data quality issues is that some records have missing attribute values. There are several different mitigation methods to deal with this problem, but each method has pros and cons."
"Why do we need data conversion?","The attributes in a dataset can be of different types, such as continuous numeric, integer numeric, or categorical."
"What is the type of data in dataset?","The attributes in a dataset can be of different types, such as continuous numeric, integer numeric, or categorical."

"What does modeling of a dataset means?","A model is the abstract representation of the data and the relationships in a given dataset." 
"Give example of predictive model","Classification and regression tasks are predictive techniques because they predict an outcome variable based on one or more input variables. Predictive algorithms require a prior known dataset to learn the model."
"What are descriptive models in data science?","Association analysis and clustering are descriptive data science techniques where there is no target variable to predict; hence, there is no test dataset. However, both predictive and descriptive models have an evaluation step."
"What is a training dataset?","The dataset used to create the model, with known attributes and a known target variable, is called the training dataset."
"What is a testing or validation dataset?","The validity of the created model is checked using a known dataset called the test dataset or validation dataset. Typically, the original dataset is split into training and test datasets."
"How is data typically split for training and testing?","A standard rule of thumb is that two-thirds of the data is used as the training dataset and one-third as the test dataset."
"What determines the choice of learning algorithm?","The business question and the availability of data determine the data science task (e.g., association, classification, regression), and the practitioner selects the appropriate algorithm within that category."
"Can multiple algorithms be used for one problem?","Yes, it is not uncommon to use multiple data science tasks and algorithms to solve a single business question."
"Give an example of a regression algorithm in data science.","Simple linear regression is a technique used to model and generalize the relationship between input and output variables in a regression task."
"How is a simple linear regression model trained and evaluated?","A training set is used to create the model, and a test set is used to evaluate its validity. For instance, a model might be trained on 7 records and tested on 3 records."
"What is the objective of simple linear regression?","The goal is to fit a straight line through the data points in a scatterplot such that the sum of squared distances from the data points to the line is minimized."
"What is the equation used in simple linear regression?","The regression line can be expressed as: Y = a * x + b, where y is the output variable, x is the input variable, a is the coefficient (slope), and b is the intercept."
"How are the parameters a and b in linear regression determined?","The values of a and b are chosen to minimize the sum of the squared residuals between the data points and the predicted line."
"What is the purpose of a linear regression model?","The fitted line serves as a model to predict the outcome of new, unlabeled data points."
 "How is a model evaluated in data science?","The model, created using training data, is evaluated by substituting values into the equation and comparing the predicted outcomes against actual values. This helps check if the model generalizes the data rather than memorizing it."
"What is overfitting in model evaluation?","Overfitting occurs when a model memorizes the training records instead of learning the underlying relationships, causing it to underperform on new, unseen data."
"Why is a test dataset important in evaluation?","The test dataset, which was not used in training, is used to evaluate the model's ability to generalize and accurately predict unseen data. It helps validate the model's effectiveness."
"How is prediction error calculated?","The actual values from the test dataset are compared with the model's predicted values. The difference between them is the prediction error, which indicates the model's accuracy."
"When is a model considered ready for deployment?","If the prediction error on the test dataset is within an acceptable range, the model is considered ready for deployment."
"How can error rates be used to compare models?","Error rates help compare the performance of models created using different algorithms, such as neural networks or Bayesian models."
"What is ensemble modeling?","Ensemble modeling is the process of using multiple diverse and independent base models to predict an outcome. This helps reduce the generalization error of predictions."
"Why are ensemble models effective?","Ensemble models rely on the 'wisdom of crowds'â€”by combining multiple models, they produce more accurate predictions than individual models. They function as a single unified model."
"Are ensemble techniques used in real-world data science?","Yes, most practical data science applications utilize ensemble modeling techniques to improve prediction performance."
"What are the final steps at the end of the modeling stage in data science?","At the end of modeling, the following are completed: Business question is analyzed. Relevant data is sourced.A suitable data science technique is selected. A proper algorithm is chosen, and data is prepared for it. The data is split into training and test sets. A model is trained on the training data. The model is validated using the test dataset."
