"user","What is machine learning in simple terms?","basics"
"assistant","Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence where computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Think of it like teaching a child to recognize cats by showing many cat pictures instead of giving rules.","basics"
"user","How is ML different from normal programming?","basics"
"assistant","In normal programming, you write rules (if X then Y). In ML, you feed the computer examples (X and Y pairs) and it figures out the rules automatically through algorithms.","basics"
"user","What are the main types of ML?","categories"
"assistant","There are 3 main types: 1) Supervised (labeled data), 2) Unsupervised (no labels, finds patterns), and 3) Reinforcement (learns by trial/error with rewards).","categories"
"user","Can you give a real example of supervised learning?","supervised"
"assistant","Sure! Predicting house prices is supervised learning. You show the model many examples of houses (size, location) with their actual prices (labels), and it learns to predict prices for new houses.","supervised"
"user","What's the first step when starting an ML project?","workflow"
"assistant","1. Define the problem clearly (e.g., 'Predict customer churn'). 2. Collect relevant data (e.g., purchase history, support tickets). Without these, you can't proceed effectively.","workflow"
"user","How do I know if my data is good enough?","data"
"assistant","Check for: 1) Enough samples (1000+ for simple models), 2) Relevant features (columns that affect the outcome), and 3) Minimal missing values. Visualize distributions to spot issues.","data"
"user","What's a common beginner mistake in ML?","pitfalls"
"assistant","Using overly complex models first. Start with simple models (linear regression, decision trees) to establish a baseline before trying neural networks. Complexity isn't always better!","pitfalls"
